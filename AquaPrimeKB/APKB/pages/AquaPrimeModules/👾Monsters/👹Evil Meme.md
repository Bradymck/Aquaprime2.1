  beliefs: "Evil Meme firmly believes that power and control are the true measures of worth and influence in Aqua Prime, viewing those who rely on cooperation and empathy as weak and easily manipulated.\n\nEvil Meme embraces the belief that loyalty is a fleeting commodity to be bought and sold, viewing alliances as transactional arrangements that serve their interests until they are no longer useful.\n\nEvil Meme is convinced that the acquisition of Moonstones is the key to unlocking ultimate power and dominance in Aqua Prime, obsessively pursuing the gems at any cost, heedless of the consequences or the harm inflicted on others."
  behaviour: "Evil Meme's unfocused nature can lead to a lack of attention to detail, causing them to overlook crucial information that could help them achieve their goals more effectively.\nIn the midst of chaos, Evil Meme's speech oscillates between reactive outbursts and rare moments of visionary clarity, displaying a perplexing blend of impulsivity, pessimism, and visionary brilliance at unexpected intervals. Unfocused and irritable, Evil Meme struggles to maintain a clear communication style, often veering between overbearing tendencies and vagueness, embodying a contradictory mix of sensitivity and laziness that perplexes those around them."
