    description: "Aqua Prime: The Memetic Convergence - A surreal and satirical journey through a vibrant, oceanic world where TTRPG elements collide with meme culture and crypto economics. Set in a universe that plays on the absurdity of digital life, Aqua Prime is a world where the lines between reality and meta-humor blur, creating a narrative as unpredictable as it is engaging."
    storycircle: 
      you: "Inhabitants of the Moonstone Maverick (Aqua Prime Discord) and the Meme Factory Cruiser. Players embody the chaotic spirit of a world where memes are currency and reality is a suggestion."
      need: "Players need to power their ships, sustain their factions, and navigate a world where every decision is a gamble and every action echoes in the surreal landscape of Aqua Prime."
      go: "Across Aqua Prime, players explore environments that parody the extremes of digital culture and economic absurdities, hunting for the ever-elusive Moonstones."
      search: "Volcanos, Deep Sea Trenches, Abandoned Underwater Cities, and Forgotten Ruinsâ€”all locations dripping with irony and steeped in the exaggerated tropes of internet and pop culture."
      find: "Moonstones, a resource as mysterious as it is powerful, symbolize the convergence of digital wealth and real-world consequences. These are the keys to sustaining life in a world teetering on the edge of satire and reality."
      take: "In a world where factions trade, barter, and steal, Moonstones and crypto assets are the lifeblood. Players must navigate this absurd economy, where wealth is as fleeting as a viral meme."
      return: "Returning to their ships with Moonstones, players face the consequences of their actions, which ripple through the narrative like a well-timed punchline. The story progresses as players deal with the fallout of their choices, often with a satirical twist."
      change: "Every action in Aqua Prime has a consequence that reverberates through the game's meta-narrative. The satirical nature of the world ensures that no decision is without its ironic implications, pushing players to question the very fabric of the game world."
    _planetarycomposition: "A world predominantly covered by water, where the few landmasses are as fleeting as the latest internet trend. Oceans, seas, and lakes serve as both the setting and the metaphor for the fluid nature of reality in Aqua Prime."
    _climate: "Tropical and temperate zones, with weather patterns as unpredictable as the storyline itself. Frequent rainfall and storms symbolize the chaotic nature of the world, where high humidity mirrors the dense atmosphere of memes and meta-commentary."
    _civilization: "Civilizations that blend advanced marine biotechnology with the absurdity of meme-driven culture. Underwater cities and habitats are both a marvel and a satire, reflecting the world's obsession with technology and digital culture."
    _economy: "An economy where fishing and trade coexist with a dying fiat currency and a booming crypto market. Moonstones power the airships, while the currency of memes and internet culture dictates the flow of resources, often with a humorous twist."
    _florafauna: "A world teeming with life that defies logic, much like the game itself. Bioluminescent algae and amphibious creatures exist alongside internet-inspired fauna, creating a bizarre ecosystem that reflects the gameâ€™s satirical tone."
    _transportation: "Airship cities and Oober services offer transportation across the seas, with a level of absurdity fitting the worldâ€™s tone. Travel is as much about the journey as it is about the destination, often leading to unexpected (and humorous) encounters."
    _resources: "Marine resources abound, but itâ€™s the Moonstones that hold true power in Aqua Prime. As both a literal and figurative source of energy, they fuel the worldâ€™s economy and the playersâ€™ progress in a landscape where scarcity and abundance are equally exaggerated."
    _geography: "A landscape defined by extremesâ€”oceanic trenches, underwater mountains, and coral reefs that parody the very idea of adventure. Sparse islands and archipelagos offer respite, but even these locations are steeped in the gameâ€™s satirical narrative."
    _technology: "Advanced marine biotechnology, cybernetics, and anti-gravity tech coexist with a deep reliance on Moonstone power. The worldâ€™s technology is both a marvel and a commentary on the absurdity of progress in a digital age."
    _culture: "A culture where the ocean is revered, but memes and internet culture hold the real power. Festivals, rituals, and art reflect a world that both honors and mocks its traditions, blending the sacred with the profane in a way that only Aqua Prime can."
    _governance: "Airships rule the skies with a 'One Ship, One Vote' system, where governance is as much about satire as it is about control. The factions wield power through influence and resources, but the real game is in navigating the absurd political landscape."
    _challenges: "Challenges include climate change, overfishing, and the ever-present threat of economic collapse. But in Aqua Prime, even these challenges are wrapped in layers of satire, making the game as much about the story as it is about survival."
    _playercharacter: "Players in Aqua Prime are more than just faction membersâ€”they are participants in a grand satire, navigating a world where every choice is laced with irony and every victory comes with a wink and a nod to the absurdity of it all."
