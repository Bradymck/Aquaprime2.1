  description: "In Aqua Prime, factions are uniquely tied to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Each faction can only be played by holding the corresponding NFT. To participate, players must link their crypto wallets in Discord, providing proof of owning the requisite NFT. Some Third Party NFT collections are avalable as well. \n\nThe core factions in the game \"Aqua Prime\" are:\n\n- Thieves Guild (d/acc)\n- Bankers/The Dank Bank (e/acc)\n- The Law (Moderators)\n- Meme Factory (Mercenaries)\n- Interdimensional Telecom (e/acc)\n- Dark Cloud Militia (d/acc)\n\nThird Party: \n- Bufficorn Cavalry\n- Doge Cult/Doge Pixel Cult"
  factionstructure: "Core Factions = Antogonists. Victims of their own design. Trapped in their very own matrix. Slaving away for the dying Sand Dollars. (Core Faction Players are given access to all in game resources)\n\nThird Party Factions:\nPlayers are required to engage with these players to earn resources. These players are encouraged to help these players escape the fiat economy into the real crypto economy. These are the crypto natives and your job is to onboard the people stuck in the very own Matrix like Truman Show. These players are a stake to play model. If you stake your NFT by holding it to gain access to that faction you will slowly earn the currently selected community token. (Subject to change)"
