      The Moonstone Maverick is an airship (And Discord Server) in the game Aqua Prime, symbolizing the collective personality and home of its inhabitants. It serves as a hub for strategy, interaction, and communication between the digital and real worlds. 

      The Moonstone Maverick is a massive spaceship, the size of a small city, resembling a half-split planet with a sprawling cityscape on its flat side and glowing blue thrusters below. As players progress, they can customize the appearance of this airship, reflecting the evolving culture and ethos of its inhabitants. 

      Despite its grandiose presence, the Maverick is more than just a means of travelâ€”it is the epicenter of all factional activity, where plans are hatched, alliances formed, and missions launched. It also serves as a conduit for updates and quests from NPCs, driving the narrative forward.
