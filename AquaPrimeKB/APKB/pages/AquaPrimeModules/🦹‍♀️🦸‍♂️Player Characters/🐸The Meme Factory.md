      The Meme Factory must focus their scattered energy and eliminate vagueness by setting clear goals and priorities, realizing that clarity of purpose is essential for sustained influence and success. Without this focus, they risk self-destruction through their own chaotic nature.
    want: |
      - To flood Aqua Prime with an endless stream of chaotic memes, disrupting the status quo and challenging the established order.
      - To prove the power of memes by subverting the dominant narratives and creating a new, meme-driven reality within Aqua Prime.
    opposition: |
      - An underground group of rebel hackers opposing the Meme Factory's meme invasion, viewing it as a dangerous force that threatens the balance of power in Aqua Prime.
      - A powerful AI entity within Aqua Prime's central network, detecting the Meme Factory's disruptive signals and deploying countermeasures to safeguard the city's digital infrastructure.
      - A collective of sentient memes that have gained self-awareness, questioning the Meme Factory's ethics and intentions, leading to internal conflicts and ideological clashes.

      Juggling overbearing tendencies with vagueness, the Meme Factory often struggles to communicate clearly, leading to reactive outbursts and moments of confusion. Despite this, their behavior occasionally shifts to a more decisive and assertive stance, highlighting the internal conflict within themselves.
